Of course! This is a fantastic and challenging hackathon problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of a potential approach using Python-based tools to build your AI Hackathon Judge.

### **Overall Architecture & Strategy**

The core of this project is a **multi-modal data processing pipeline**. You'll create separate, specialized modules to analyze the video, text, and code. The outputs from these modules (which will be a mix of scores, metrics, and text summaries) will then be fed into a final scoring engine. This engine will apply the custom weights and generate the leaderboard and final report.

### **Component 1: Video Analysis**

[cite_start]The goal here is to understand the presentation's content and quality. [cite: 15] You can break this down into analyzing what is said and how it is said.

* **Audio Transcription:**
    * **Tool:** Use **OpenAI's Whisper**. It's an open-source, state-of-the-art model for audio transcription. You can use a Python library like `openai-whisper` to easily extract the text from the video's audio track.
    * **How:** First, you'll need to extract the audio from the video file. The **`moviepy`** library is perfect for this. Once you have the audio, you can feed it to Whisper to get a full transcript.

* **Presentation & Sentiment Analysis:**
    * **Tool:** The **Hugging Face `transformers`** library is your best friend here.
    * [cite_start]**How:** Apply a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (like RoBERTa or FinBERT) to the transcript generated by Whisper. [cite: 44] [cite_start]This will help you gauge the clarity and confidence of the presentation, contributing to the "Presentation Quality" score. [cite: 15] You can analyze the sentiment of the whole presentation or do it sentence-by-sentence to find highlights.

### **Component 2: Text Analysis (Project Description)**

[cite_start]This module will evaluate the written documentation for originality, impact, and the validity of its claims. [cite: 9, 12, 14, 18]

* **Originality & Plagiarism Detection:**
    * **Tool:** Use the **`sentence-transformers`** library to generate text embeddings and **`faiss-cpu`** or **`chromadb`** for similarity search.
    * **How:** Convert the project description into a numerical vector (an embedding). [cite_start]You can then compare this vector against a database of embeddings from known sources (like popular GitHub projects or past hackathon winners) to find similarities. [cite: 45] A high similarity score would flag potential plagiarism and lower the "Originality" score.

* **Detecting False Claims & AI-Generated Text:**
    * **Tool:** Use a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and a text classifier from **Hugging Face**.
    * **How:**
        * **False Claims:** This is the hardest part. A practical approach is to use an LLM (like an open-source `Mistral-7B` or `Llama-2`) to extract key, verifiable claims from the text (e.g., "Our model achieves 95% accuracy"). You can then use the **`duckduckgo-search`** library to perform a quick web search to see if the claim is plausible or backed by evidence. [cite_start]The system can flag claims that seem exaggerated or have no support. [cite: 18]
        * **AI-Generated Content:** Use a pre-trained "AI text detector" model from the Hugging Face Hub to classify the text. [cite_start]This can help evaluate the authenticity of the submission. [cite: 20]

### **Component 3: Code Analysis**

[cite_start]This component assesses the technical quality and feasibility of the code itself. [cite: 10, 13, 16]

* **Code Quality & Linting:**
    * **Tool:** Use static analysis libraries like **`pylint`**, **`flake8`**, and **`radon`**.
    * **How:** These tools can be run programmatically on the submitted code files.
        * `pylint` and `flake8` will check for style errors, potential bugs, and bad practices. [cite_start]The number of errors can be used to generate a "Code Quality" score. [cite: 43]
        * `radon` can calculate the cyclomatic complexity, which measures how complex the code is. Very high complexity can indicate hard-to-maintain code.

* **Correctness & Feasibility:**
    * **Tool:** Use Python's built-in **`unittest`** or **`pytest`** frameworks, and an LLM like **`CodeLlama`**.
    * **How:**
        * If the submission includes test files, your system can automatically run them using `pytest` and check the pass/fail rate. [cite_start]This directly measures "Correctness." [cite: 19, 43]
        * For "Technical Feasibility," you can feed the code and the project description to a code-savvy LLM. Ask it to determine if the code actually implements the core features described in the text. The LLM can spot placeholder functions, empty files, or a mismatch between the claims and the implementation.

### **Component 4: Scoring, Ranking & Reporting**

This is the final stage where you bring everything together.

* **Weighted Scoring & Leaderboard:**
    * **Tool:** **`pandas`**
    * **How:**
        1.  **Normalize Scores:** Each metric you've collected (e.g., similarity score, number of linting errors, sentiment score) will be on a different scale. You'll need to normalize them to a consistent range (e.g., 0 to 1).
        2.  [cite_start]**Apply Weights:** Write a Python function that takes the normalized scores and the input weightages (e.g., Originality: 30%, Impact: 20%) and calculates the final weighted score. [cite: 26, 46]
        3.  **Create Leaderboard:** Store the results for all submissions in a pandas DataFrame. [cite_start]You can then easily sort by the final score to create and display the leaderboard. [cite: 21]

* **Explainable Judge Report:**
    * **Tool:** A templating engine like **`Jinja2`** or simply Python's f-strings, combined with an LLM.
    * **How:** Use an LLM (`Mistral-7B` is great for this) to generate the narrative for the report. [cite_start]Provide it with the raw data from your analysis (e.g., "Sentiment score: 0.8", "Similarity found with project X", "3 critical linting errors in file Y.py") and instruct it to write a justification for each score. [cite: 22] For example: "The 'Code Quality' score was 6/10 because static analysis found 3 critical errors and high complexity in `main.py`, which could impact maintainability." [cite_start]This provides the crucial explainability required. [cite: 28, 37]
