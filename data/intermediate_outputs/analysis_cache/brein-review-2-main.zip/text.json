    "combined_summary": "This hackathon project tackles the significant challenge of limited online resources for American Sign Language (ASL) translation. It aims to bridge the communication gap by creating a web-based tool that translates ASL hand gestures into the English alphabet. The project utilizes OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for hand gesture tracking based on landmark coordinates. Despite current limitations in handling dynamic gestures, the project accurately maps static hand positions for each letter. The project's core technologies include OpenCV, MediaPipe, potentially Flask, JavaScript, and CSS, highlighting its focus on web accessibility. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide a learning platform for ASL, offering a valuable resource for both ASL learners and those seeking to communicate with the deaf community."
