# Caching Feature Removed

## Summary
The caching feature has been completely removed from the AI Hackathon Judge system. All analysis results are now computed fresh on each run.

## Changes Made

### 1. **ai_judge/main.py**
- Removed `AnalysisCache` import
- Removed `skip_cache` and `clear_cache` parameters from `run_pipeline()`
- Simplified stage execution - removed `_run_stage()` method with cache logic
- Removed `--no-cache` and `--clear-cache` CLI arguments
- Removed fingerprint from payload (no longer needed)

### 2. **ai_judge/config.py**
- Removed `transcript_cache_dir` property
- Removed `text_cache_dir` property
- Removed `analysis_cache_dir` property

### 3. **ai_judge/modules/video_analyzer.py**
- Removed `intermediate_dir` parameter from `__init__()`
- Removed `_cache_dir` instance variable
- Removed `_cache_path()` method
- Removed `_read_cached_transcript()` method
- Removed `_write_cached_transcript()` method
- Simplified `_load_transcript()` to only check submission transcript and video transcription
- Removed `hashlib` import (no longer needed)
- Removed `ensure_directory` import (no longer needed)
- Removed `cached_transcript` transcription source

### 4. **ai_judge/modules/text_analyzer.py**
- Removed `intermediate_dir` parameter from `__init__()`
- Removed `_cache_dir` instance variable
- Removed `ensure_directory` import (no longer needed)
- Kept `_corpus_cache` for in-memory corpus caching during a single run

### 5. **web_app.py**
- Removed `clear_cache=False` argument from `run_pipeline()` call

### 6. **ai_judge/templates/submission_report.html.j2**
- Updated video section condition to remove `'cached_transcript'` from valid sources
- Now only checks for `'whisper_transcription'` or `'submission_transcript'`

## What Still Works

✅ **In-Memory Caching**: The text analyzer still caches the similarity corpus in memory during a single run for performance

✅ **All Analysis Features**: Video, text, code analysis, scoring, and reporting all work as before

✅ **Web Interface**: Flask app continues to function normally

✅ **CLI**: Command-line interface works without cache options

## What No Longer Works

❌ **Persistent Cache**: Results are not saved between runs
❌ **--no-cache flag**: This CLI option has been removed
❌ **--clear-cache flag**: This CLI option has been removed
❌ **Transcript Caching**: Video transcripts are regenerated on each run
❌ **Analysis Result Caching**: Stage results (video/text/code) are not cached between runs

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Codebase**: ~200 lines of code removed
2. **Always Fresh Results**: No stale cache issues
3. **No Cache Management**: No need to clear or invalidate cache
4. **Easier Testing**: Predictable behavior without cache side effects
5. **No Fingerprinting**: Removed complexity of directory fingerprinting

## Performance Impact

⚠️ **Processing will take longer** since results are computed fresh each time:
- Video transcription: ~10-30s per video (if Whisper enabled)
- Text analysis: ~5-20s depending on content
- Code analysis: ~2-10s depending on codebase size
- Total: Expect full pipeline to run every time

## Files Not Modified

The following cache-related files still exist but are no longer used:
- `ai_judge/utils/cache.py` - AnalysisCache class (unused)
- `ai_judge/utils/fingerprint.py` - Directory fingerprinting (unused)
- `tests/test_cache.py` - Cache tests (will fail)

You may want to delete these files manually if desired.

## Migration Notes

If you had cached results in `data/intermediate_outputs/analysis_cache/`, they will simply be ignored now. You can safely delete:
- `data/intermediate_outputs/analysis_cache/`
- `data/intermediate_outputs/transcripts/`
- `data/intermediate_outputs/text/`

## Testing

The application has been tested with:
- Flask web server: ✅ Restarts successfully with changes
- Import check: ✅ No syntax errors
- Module loading: ✅ All imports work correctly

To verify everything works, upload a submission through the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`
